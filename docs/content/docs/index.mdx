description: Class-based reactive state management for modern UI frameworks
---

Define classes to power your UI. Properties become reactive automatically — when they change, your components update too.

```tsx
import State from '@expressive/react';

class Counter extends State {
  count = 0;

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }

  decrement() {
    this.count--;
  }
}

function CounterWidget() {
  const { count, increment, decrement } = Counter.use();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it. No reducers, no selectors, no boilerplate. Just a class and a hook.

## What you get

- **One import** — `State` is all you need. No extra packages for async, context, computed values, or validation.
- **Type safety for free** — classes give you autocompletion, refactoring, and type inference out of the box.
- **Fine-grained reactivity** — components only re-render when the properties they actually read change.
- **Portable logic** — state lives in classes, not components. Easy to test, reuse, and reason about.
- **AI-friendly** — explicit classes with clear properties and methods are easy for both humans and AI to navigate.
